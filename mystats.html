            I'm from Warangal, India. When I was young, I wanted to be a soldier and serve the nation, but due to some unfortunate circumstances, I had to leave that dream behind.

        <p>
            Biryani is one of the famous dishes in hyderabad. Fresh herbs, saffron, and basmati rice give it a sweet-floral aroma that hits the nose before you taste it. Biryani is known for its aroma and flavor.The best part about chicken biryani is that each serving provides the best nutrients. Chicken and cashew nuts provide the protein quotient of nutrients.
